# Priam

## Purpose (**NOTE: Check out the [Priam](https://www.github.com/kingtechnician/priam_lite) application README before reading this.**)

 - Are you a Virginia State University student who has a new idea or concern they would like to make known to the university administration?
 - Are you unsure of the resources or means necessary?
 
 A solution presented by me, Isaiah Freeman, is Priam, web application that has the goal of making the desires of students more visible to faculty and administration at VSU.
 
 ## How?
 - The Priam system is simple: you might consider it a voting system. Students have the ability to create an account, and propose changes they would like to make to the university in a short post.
 - Categories can be added to the posts to better organize the nature of their requests.
 Other users have the ability to view these public posts and have the optoon to upvote them.
 - Other users have the ability to iew these public posts and have the option to upvote them.
 - These posts are anonymous. No one will know the author of the post.
 - There are no comments. No judgement necesary.
 - The only metric is upvotes.
 
 There are also basic searching methods to allow you to search posts by name, title or date. You can also sort by category.
